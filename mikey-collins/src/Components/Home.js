            Hoick is the solo album from Allo Darlinâ€™ drummer Mikey Collins, who
            combines his love of solid grooves and joyous harmonies to create a
            fun and sonically varied record. Mikey played most of the
            instruments and mixed the record himself, with some assistance from
            Laura Kovic (Tigercats) on vocals and fellow Allo Darlin' member
            Paul Rains on lead guitar. The flicker of his previous band provided
            the building blocks of an upbeat, positive record, but Mikey wanted
            to add his own quirky, disco spin & sonic expansiveness, aided by
            co-producer John Winfield (who has worked with Jimmy Somerville),
            with the aim of making a record that people stood a chance of being
            able to dance to.
